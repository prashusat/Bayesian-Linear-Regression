<b>Bayesian-Linear-Regression</b>
<br/>
<b>Overview: </b>Experiments with Bayesian Linear Regression
Your goals in this assignment are (i) to investigate the eect of the number of examples, the number
of features, and the regularization parameter on the performance of the corresponding algorithms,
and (ii) to investigate two methods for model selection in linear regression (evidence maximization
and cross validation). In all your experiments you should report the performance in terms of the
mean square error
